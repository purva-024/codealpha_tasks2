**Unemployment Trends During COVID-19** 

* Sharp Increase in March 2020:
  Unemployment spiked dramatically during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and, although it later declined, remained higher than pre-pandemic levels.

* Regional and Area Variation:
  The impact varied widely across regions and between rural vs urban areas, with some experiencing much more severe job losses.

* Seasonal Patterns Present but Minimal:
  While some seasonality was observed (e.g., recurring annual trends), it was overshadowed by the pandemic’s impact.

* Trend Analysis:
  The trend component showed a steep rise starting in March 2020, then a gradual decline, but not back to pre-pandemic levels.
